- **FEAT**(export/import): Introduce reference-based export mechanism to reduce redundancy and significantly minimize export file size.
- **FEAT**(export/import): Add `enableMinify` option to `ExportEditorConfigs` (enabled by default), which further reduces the output file size by minifying key structures. Even with minification disabled, export sizes are notably smaller due to optimizations.

See pull request [#315](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/pull/315) for more details.

## 7.4.0

## 7.0.1
- **FIX**(zoom): Corrected the layer rotation calculation when the user drags the rotation button. This resolves issue [#266](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/issues/266)

### Changed
- **File Structure Update**:
  - Moved `custom widgets`, `icons`, and `theme` files into the `configs` directory for better organization.
  - Renamed all `theme` files to `styles` to better reflect their purpose.

### Breaking Changes
- File renaming and restructuring require updates to your configuration file:
  - `custom widgets`, `icons`, and `theme` files are now located directly in the `configs` directory of the editor.
  - All theme classes are renamed to end with `Style` for consistency.
