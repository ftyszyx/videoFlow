  /// This offset is relative to the child's size, where (0, 0) represents
  /// no translation, and values are scaled based on the childâ€™s width and
  /// height.
  ///
  /// For example, an [Offset] of (0.25, 0.0) translates the child 25% of its
  /// width to the right, while (-0.5, -0.5) centers the child if its
  /// alignment is top-left.
